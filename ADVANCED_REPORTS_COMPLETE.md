## 📊 **Technical Details**

### **Cash Flow Statement Logic**

```
Operating Activities:
├─ Net Income (Revenue - Expenses)
├─ + Non-Cash Adjustments (Depreciation, Amortization)
└─ + Working Capital Changes
   ├─ Δ Accounts Receivable (increase = use of cash)
   ├─ Δ Accounts Payable (increase = source of cash)
   └─ Δ Inventory (increase = use of cash)
= Net Cash from Operations

Investing Activities: (framework ready)
├─ Asset Purchases
└─ Asset Sales

Financing Activities: (framework ready)
├─ Loans
└─ Equity

= Net Change in Cash
```

### **Tax Summary Logic**

```
Tax Collection Sources:
├─ Shopify Orders
│  ├─ Parse taxLines JSON
│  ├─ Group by jurisdiction/rate
│  └─ Sum amounts
├─ Journal Entries
│  ├─ Find Tax accounts
│  ├─ Sum credit - debit
│  └─ Group by account name
└─ Total Tax Collected = Shopify + Journals
```

### **Expense/Revenue Breakdown Logic**

```
1. Fetch all journal lines for period
2. Filter by account type (EXPENSE/COGS or REVENUE)
3. Group by account name
4. Calculate totals per account
5. Sort by amount (descending)
6. Calculate percentages
7. Return top N + full breakdown
```

<TabsTrigger value="expenses">Expense Breakdown</TabsTrigger>
```

2. **Create Tab Content:**
```typescript
{activeTab === 'cashflow' && (
  // Fetch using reportsService.getCashFlow()
  // Display operating activities, net cash from operations, etc.
)}
```

3. **Use Existing Chart Components:**
- Bar charts for cash flow components
- Pie charts for expense/revenue breakdown
- Tables for detailed line items

### **Backend Enhancements**
The service layer is production-ready but can be enhanced:

1. **Account Flags** - Add `isAR`, `isAP`, `isInventory`, `isDepreciation` to Account model for more accurate calculations

2. **Period Balances** - Store opening balances for exact working capital changes
