## 🔌 Integrating AI (Optional)

The AI Assistant is designed to be modular. To integrate with OpenAI or Gemini:

### Option 1: OpenAI Integration

```typescript
// In client/src/services/aiService.ts
import OpenAI from 'openai'

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY,
  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true
})

export async function getAIResponse(query: string, context: any) {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a financial assistant for an e-commerce accounting system."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: `Context: ${JSON.stringify(context)}\n\nQuestion: ${query}`
      }
    ]
  })
  
  return completion.choices[0].message.content
}
```

### Option 2: Gemini Integration

```typescript
// In client/src/services/aiService.ts
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from '@google/generative-ai'

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY)

export async function getAIResponse(query: string, context: any) {
  const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro" })
  
  const prompt = `You are a financial assistant. Context: ${JSON.stringify(context)}\n\nQuestion: ${query}`
  
  const result = await model.generateContent(prompt)
  return result.response.text()
}
```

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Using the AI Assistant Programmatically

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* AI Assistant will appear as floating button */}
      <AIAssistant />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Creating Animated Components

```typescript
import { AnimatedCard, AnimatedStatCard } from './components/AnimatedCard'

function MyStats() {
  return (
    <AnimatedStatCard
      name="Total Revenue"
      value="$125,000"
      icon={DollarSign}
      change="+12%"
      changeType="positive"
      delay={0.1}
    />
  )
}
```

### Using Page Transitions

```typescript
import { PageTransition } from './components/PageTransition'

  )
}
```

## 📝 Customization Guide

### Changing Primary Color

Edit `client/tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
primary: {
  500: '#YOUR_COLOR',
  // ... other shades
}
```

### Adjusting Animation Speed

Edit component files and modify `duration` values:
```typescript
transition={{ duration: 0.3 }} // Faster
transition={{ duration: 0.8 }} // Slower
```

### Customizing AI Responses

Edit `client/src/components/AIAssistant.tsx`:
```typescript
const getAIResponse = (query: string): string => {
  // Add your custom logic here
}
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **AI Assistant**: Currently uses mock responses. Requires API integration for production.
2. **Report Export**: Simulated exports. Requires backend implementation.
3. **Multi-Store Data**: Uses mock data. Connect to real Shopify API for production.
